## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

Research questions: Does this change with recommended ages? 
Does this change with different game categories?
