## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}
#board_games%>%
#  arrange(desc(max_playtime))

board_games <- board_games %>%
  mutate(
    playtime_group = case_when(
      playing_time < 1 ~ "N/A",
      playing_time >= 1 & playing_time <= 20 ~ "Under 20 minutes",
      playing_time >= 21 & playing_time <= 40 ~ "20-40 minutes",
      playing_time >= 41 & playing_time <= 60 ~ "40-60 minutes",
      playing_time >= 61 & playing_time <= 120 ~ "1-2 hours",
      playing_time >= 121 & playing_time <= 180 ~ "2-3 hours",
      playing_time >= 181 & playing_time <= 240 ~ "3-4 hours",
      playing_time >= 241 & playing_time <= 360 ~ "4-6 hours",
      playing_time >= 361 ~ "Over 6 hours"
    ))
```

```{r}
board_games%>%
  count(playtime_group)%>%
  arrange(desc(n))
```

```{r}
ggplot(data = board_games, x = playtime_group, color=)
```




```{r}
board_games %>% 
  filter(playing_time < 1200) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = playing_time , y = average_rating)) +
  geom_point(position = "jitter") +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") 
```
